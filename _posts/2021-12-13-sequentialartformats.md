besonasige - The sequential art form descended from Shinkoma and left wing anarchist culture that became the default comics medium, with Four Frame Novels ( Enovo Shinkoma ) being a prototype. Unlike manga, focuses on sequential art with a mixture of western and Japanese brushes, pens, and inks following "hard and soft" pattern. The term itself is derived from "Besong Shige" or recited poetry.<br />
