## Prerequisites For Learning Fraponic.

Some prerequisites that can help learning:

* Take a least two classes of French on Memrise and Duolingo.

* Take at least one class of Japanese Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji.

* Familiarize yourself with Tokipona and Lojban for ideas of simpler languages.

## Fraponic As Language Preservation

* Fraponic aims to preserve French and Japanese vocabulary by forming a common index that French and Japanese users can use when they do not speak each other's language.

* But it can also be seen as its own cultural language in its own right.
